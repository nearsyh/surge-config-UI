# Surge-On

This project is a GUI for [Surge Config Server](https://github.com/nearsyh/surge-config-server). It provides a simple way to modify your surge configuration.

## How to run locally

You can run this locally using

```bash
npm run serve
```

**Note** you need to add `VUE_APP_SERVER_HOST={your server address}` to your `.env` file. Otherwise, it uses `localhost:8080` as the server address.
